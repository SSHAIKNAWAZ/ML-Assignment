# Blockhouse Assignment: Machine Learning Engineer Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to the Machine Learning Engineer work trial at Blockhouse. This task evaluates your ability to implement and fine-tune transformer-based models for generating trade recommendations. Below is a detailed summary of the steps taken, including data preparation, model implementation, fine-tuning, evaluation metrics, and documentation.

## Resources Used
- **Transformer Model:** Implemented using TensorFlow.
- **Data Source:** Historical trade data from trades_EQUITIES.csv.
- **Yahoo Finance API:** Used to fetch additional market data (e.g., stock prices, volumes).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Task Breakdown
### Data Preparation
- **Loading Data:** Loaded trade data from trades_EQUITIES.csv.
- **Data Integration:** Merged trade data with market data fetched from Yahoo Finance API to create a comprehensive dataset.

### Model Implementation
- **Transformer Model:** Implemented using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Utilized transformer layers** for processing trade and market data.
- **Configured positional encoding and attention mechanisms** for effective feature extraction.

### Fine-Tuning
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized model performance through:
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
  - Learning rate scheduling for more stable convergence and faster training.

## Evaluation
### Metrics Used
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, providing insight into model accuracy.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values, highlighting overall prediction error.

### Performance Assessment
- **Achieved MAE:** 19.11
- **Achieved RMSE:** 22.63
